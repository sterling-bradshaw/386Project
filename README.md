# 386Project
Welcome to the 386Project Repository!

In the Project.ipynb you will find the code used for my blog post found here: [myblogpost](https://sterling-bradshaw.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/15/Data-Gather.html)

Soon there will be more code added here explaining the EDA portion of the project.
